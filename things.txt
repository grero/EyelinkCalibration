infra-red camera: Model: DLM-680SEV
we need to get a BNC to RCA converter for the camera, so that we can connect it to the elgato.

Regarding calibration, Eyelink will also use the latest calibration model, i.e. calibrating on Monday and running a
different experiment on Tuesday will use Monday's calibration.

Can we get a new solenoid? One that doesn't overheat so easily, preferably one that runs on lower voltage.
