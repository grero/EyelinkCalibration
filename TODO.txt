#TODO: USe video as tracking stimulus
#FIXME: Look into why rewarded fixations appear to fall outside the allowed window.
#TODO: Add uncertainty to the fixation tracking
#TODO: Maintain a count of total reward, correct, and incorrect trials for the day
#TODO: Use a moving grating as the calibration target. Right now he is just glancing at the dots/banana, but looks away too
quickly to identify a fixation
#TODO: Put a camera so that we can observe the monkey while he works
#TODO: Try using a texture as mouse cursor during the calibration (perhaps an insect of some kind) to attract the monkey's
attention. Or, just drag a picture around.
#TODO: Try using 'return' key callback to give reward when a calibration point is accepted
#TODO: Bring a notebook so that we can keep notes during the experiment
#TODO: Have a separate calibration task (maybe not)
#TODO: Allow experimenter to flash the calibration spot during calibration
#TODO: We could check that the monkey does not enter other locations other than the target in the response window
#TODO: Install pygit2 on the windows computer
#TODO: Make sure we can send strobes through the parallel port
#WIP: Make sure we align the trials to the screen flip
#TODO: Figure out why python crashes
#TODO: Add target crosses in the fixation task as well.
#TODO: Separate experimental time into time on task and idle time
#WIP: Randomly cycle through fixation locations which can be interrupted, should be resumed when done
#TODO: Adjust ITI according to the motivation of the monkey
#TODO: Look into using the 'tracked' field of the eyelink sample to check blinks
#TODO: Look into having a separate calibration button
#TODO: Try using 2kHz sampling for eyelink
#WIP: Add feedback on the experimenter's plot on how many trials have been completed
#TODO: Add drift correct. We might be better off just recalibrating
#TODO: Create a file writing module to keep track of version number of the settings
